Capstone 2: Keep It Running — Observability and Reliability

This project extends the original Robot Shop application with monitoring, centralized logging, distributed tracing, SLO-based alerting, and incident response capabilities.

This sample microservice application has been built using these technologies:
- NodeJS ([Express](http://expressjs.com/))
- Java ([Spring Boot](https://spring.io/))
- Python ([Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org))
- Golang
- PHP (Apache)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- MySQL ([Maxmind](http://www.maxmind.com) data)
- RabbitMQ
- Nginx
- AngularJS (1.x)

The following components and practices have been added:

Prometheus and Grafana: Metrics collection, monitoring, and visualization.

Fluent Bit and Loki: Log collection and centralized log analysis.

OpenTelemetry Collector and Jaeger: Distributed trace collection and analysis.

Service Level Objective (SLO): A target availability of 99%, documented in SLO.md.

Alerting: SLO-based alert rules and Alertmanager configuration for Slack notifications.

Incident response: Troubleshooting and recovery procedures documented in RUNBOOK.md.

Observability Configuration

The observability stack is deployed and managed from the observability/ directory.

Component		            	Configuration file

Alertmanager		        	observability/alertmanager-values.yaml

SLO alerts		            	observability/slo-alerts.yaml

Fluent Bit		            	observability/fluent-bit.yaml

Loki		            		observability/loki-values.yaml

OpenTelemetry Collector	    	observability/otel-collector.yaml

Jaeger			            	observability/jaeger.yaml

These additions support service health monitoring, incident detection, troubleshooting, and reliability improvement for the Robot Shop application.

```shell
$ export INSTANA_AGENT_KEY="<your agent key>"
```

Now build all the images.

```shell
$ docker-compose build
```

If you modified the `.env` file and changed the image registry, you need to push the images to that registry

```shell
$ docker-compose push
```

## Run Locally
You can run it locally for testing.

If you did not build from source, don't worry all the images are on Docker Hub. Just pull down those images first using:

```shell
$ docker-compose pull
```

Fire up Stan's Robot Shop with:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

If you want to fire up some load as well:

```shell
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose-load.yaml up
```

## Kubernetes
You can run Kubernetes locally using [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) or on one of the many cloud providers.

The Docker container images are all available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/robotshop/).

Install Stan's Robot Shop to your Kubernetes cluster using the [Helm](K8s/helm/README.md) chart.

To deploy the Instana agent to Kubernetes, just use the [helm](https://github.com/instana/helm-charts) chart.

## Accessing the Store
If you are running the store locally via *docker-compose up* then, the store front is available on localhost port 8080 [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

If you are running the store on Kubernetes via minikube then, find the IP address of Minikube and the Node Port of the web service.

```shell
$ minikube ip
$ kubectl get svc web
```

If you are using a cloud Kubernetes / Openshift / Mesosphere then it will be available on the load balancer of that system.
 

## Website Monitoring / End-User Monitoring

### Docker Compose

To enable Website Monioring / End-User Monitoring (EUM) see the official [documentation](https://docs.instana.io/website_monitoring/) for how to create a configuration. There is no need to inject the JavaScript fragment into the page, this will be handled automatically. Just make a note of the unique key and set the environment variable `INSTANA_EUM_KEY` and `INSTANA_EUM_REPORTING_URL` for the web image within `docker-compose.yaml`.

### Kubernetes

The Helm chart for installing Stan's Robot Shop supports setting the key and endpoint url required for website monitoring, see the [README](K8s/helm/README.md).

## Prometheus

The cart and payment services both have Prometheus metric endpoints. These are accessible on `/metrics`. The cart service provides:

* Counter of the number of items added to the cart

The payment services provides:

* Counter of the number of items perchased
* Histogram of the total number of items in each cart
* Histogram of the total value of each cart

To test the metrics use:

```shell
$ curl http://<host>:8080/api/cart/metrics
$ curl http://<host>:8080/api/payment/metrics
```
